# 07. Multi-Agent Collaboration

## What is the Multi-Agent Collaboration Pattern?

This pattern addresses the limitations of a single agent by structuring a system as a cooperative team of distinct, specialized agents. A high-level objective is broken down into sub-problems, and each is assigned to an agent with the specific tools, data access, or reasoning capabilities best suited for that task.

Collaboration can take various forms, including:
-   **Sequential Handoffs**: One agent passes its output to the next.
-   **Parallel Processing**: Agents work on different parts of a problem simultaneously.
-   **Hierarchical Structures**: A manager agent delegates tasks to worker agents.
-   **Expert Teams**: Agents with different domain knowledge (e.g., researcher, writer) collaborate.

The system's effectiveness depends on clear roles, a shared communication protocol, and a well-defined task flow.

## Why is it useful?

A multi-agent architecture offers several advantages over a monolithic agent:

-   **Modularity & Specialization**: Each agent can be an expert in a specific domain, making the system more capable and easier to maintain.
-   **Scalability**: Tasks can be processed in parallel, improving performance.
-   **Robustness**: The failure of a single agent does not necessarily cause a total system failure.
-   **Synergy**: The collective performance of the group can surpass the capabilities of any single agent.

## Rule of Thumb

Use this pattern when a task is too complex for a single agent and can be decomposed into distinct sub-tasks requiring specialized skills or tools. It is ideal for problems that benefit from diverse expertise, parallel processing, or a structured workflow with multiple stages, such as complex research, software development, or creative content generation.

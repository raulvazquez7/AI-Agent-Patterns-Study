# 03. Parallelization

## What is Parallelization?

The **Parallelization** pattern involves executing multiple components—such as LLM calls, tool usages, or entire sub-agents—concurrently. Instead of waiting for one step to complete before starting the next, this pattern allows independent tasks to run at the same time.

This approach is crucial for optimizing workflows that can be broken down into independent sub-tasks, significantly reducing the overall execution time.

## Why is it useful?

A purely sequential execution, where each task waits for the previous one to finish, is often inefficient and slow, especially when tasks depend on external operations with latency (like API calls or database queries). Without a mechanism for concurrent execution, the total processing time becomes the sum of all individual task durations.

Parallelization addresses this bottleneck by running independent tasks simultaneously. The final result is typically created in a subsequent sequential step that aggregates the outputs from all parallel branches.

## Key Points

-   **Efficiency**: Drastically reduces the total execution time for workflows with independent tasks.
-   **Concurrency**: Executes multiple operations (LLM calls, tool use) at the same time.
-   **Independent Tasks**: The core idea is to identify parts of a workflow that do not depend on the output of other parts.
-   **Aggregation**: The results from parallel tasks are often combined or synthesized in a final step.
-   **Frameworks**: LangChain (with `RunnableParallel`) and Google ADK (with `ParallelAgent`) provide built-in constructs to manage concurrent operations.

## Practical Use Cases

-   **Information Gathering**: An agent can research a topic by querying multiple sources (news APIs, databases, web search) simultaneously.
-   **Multi-API Interaction**: A travel agent can check for flights, hotels, and local events concurrently instead of one by one.
-   **Content Generation**: An agent can generate different components of a report (e.g., summary, key points, introduction) in parallel and then assemble them.
-   **A/B Testing**: Generate multiple variations of a response or creative text at the same time to select the best one.

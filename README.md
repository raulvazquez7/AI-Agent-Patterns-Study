# A Practical Study of AI Agent Design Patterns

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository serves as my personal learning journal as I explore the world of intelligent systems and AI agents. It is a hands-on implementation of the concepts presented in the book **"Agentic Design Patterns: A Hands-On Guide to Building Intelligent Systems"** by Antonio Gulli.

The core idea is to not just replicate, but to actively implement, experiment with, and evolve the examples provided in the book. This serves as a practical exercise to deepen my understanding of the 21 foundational patterns that are becoming essential for building sophisticated, autonomous agents.

## Attribution and Acknowledgment

All credit for the original concepts, techniques, and foundational examples belongs to the author. This repository is purely for educational purposes and to document my journey as an AI Engineer.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by pattern, with each technique from the book in its own numbered folder. Each folder will contain the code implementation and a specific `README.md` with my notes and specifix examples on that particular pattern.

-   `01_prompt_chaining/`
-   `02_.../`
-   ...and so on for all 21 patterns.
